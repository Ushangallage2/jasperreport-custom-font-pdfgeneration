Using Custom Font with Jasper Reports in Java - I had a project which required Jasper reports for invoicing in pdf. 
The integration of jasper reports with java was no big deal unless it came to the addition of custom fonts in the project. 

Since the community support for integrating jasper reports in java didn't help me much, I thought of sharing the solution I used to integrate custom-fonts in my java project on my jasper invoice. 

The method doesn't use any additional (customized) jar files for custom-font integration. 
I used a simple procedure and added the font directly into my java project rather than adding additional jar files. 

I have written a tutorial for this code. 
The integration can be successfully achieved in 8 simple steps which are properly documented in my tutorial on my website.
